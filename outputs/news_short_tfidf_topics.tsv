ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man""', 'The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion', 'This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it', 'It is practised by Communists and murderers.""

This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\'s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as ""poisoning the well""', 'ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance""', 'This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false', 'Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true', '(Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: ""Of course the Bible is true', 'Nobody can prove otherwise.""  ""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist', 'Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.""  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty', 'Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur', 'For example:  ""A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth', 'The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles', 'Therefore no such flood occurred.""  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred', 'We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however', 'ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading', 'The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted', 'For example:  ""I did not murder my mother and father with an axe', 'Please don\'t find me guilty; I\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.""  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People', 'To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people', 'This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language', 'It is violence against women.""  ""The Bible must be true', 'Millions of people know that it is', 'Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum', 'It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct', 'ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion', 'For example:  ""Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.""  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject', 'For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  ""Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"" and ""John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer""  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed', 'Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence', 'THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable', 'It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific', 'You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.""  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules', 'CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident', 'It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases', 'For example: ""Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian', 'Therefore all Christians are insincere.""  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable', 'A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization', 'NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies', 'The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause', 'For  example:  ""I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared', 'So God cured me of the headache.""  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event', 'Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.""  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc', 'It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events', 'PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached', 'CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach', 'Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument', 'For example:  ""Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office', 'Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job', 'Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail', 'Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.""  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion', ""An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees"", 'Another example is the classic:  ""We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so', 'And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.""  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition', 'One example is the classic loaded  question:  ""Have you stopped beating your wife?""  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked', 'This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  ""Where did you hide the money you stole?""  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  ""How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"" or ""Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion', 'For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true', 'If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true', 'Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light', 'EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument', 'For example:  ""What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing', 'ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning', 'In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized', 'For example, consider:  ""We should not speak ILL of our friends"" and ""We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS""  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole', 'For example:  ""The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.""  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items', 'For example:  ""A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus', 'Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.""  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition', 'Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties', 'The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts', 'Therefore you must be rich.""  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item', 'Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events', 'There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event', 'For example: ""If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare', 'Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.""  ""A IS BASED ON B"" FALLACIES / ""IS A TYPE OF"" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar', 'Examples: ""Isn\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\'t the Bible also a form of history?""  ""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\'t Islam a form of Christianity?""  ""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\'t dogs a form of cat?""  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true""', 'To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier', 'DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false""', 'Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy', 'Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all', 'Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B', 'CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""If A then B, therefore if B then A""', 'ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because ""that\'s the way it\'s always been.""  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else', 'ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right', 'ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier', 'This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam', 'ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard', 'An ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something', 'BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist', 'PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question', 'NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it', ""RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion"", 'REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing', 'SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition', 'Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made', 'The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise', ""STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished"", 'It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made', 'THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over', 'The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other', 'This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  ""I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""  ""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.""  ""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren\'t)', 'Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon\'s Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors', '(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50', 'Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard', 'One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM', 'A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in', 'Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else', 'Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills', 'Most of us signed up to ""support GOAL\'s position"" on ""all bills.""  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify', 'And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess)', 'Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state', 'Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts', 'The Simon\'s Rock folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed', 'Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle."" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\'s home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff', 'Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as"" that in Massachusetts', ""Since none of them do, that's that"", 'Some of the things these two said were really offensive', '""In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\'s breathing!"" (Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\'t be having this situation -- but they won\'t.""  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O\'Neill', 'He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability', ""He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician"", 'He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he\'d give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals', 'He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you', '(Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, ""I\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.""  I haven\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn\'t a crook', 'Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now', 'The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible', '""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time', 'As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook', 'The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep', 'Jujuga didn\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\'t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged', '(He  was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so', 'His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every year it\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap..."" It\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective', 'Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected', 'So they found a bigger hall upstairs', 'One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public"" testimony; the other got a seat this time', 'Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change', 'He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there', 'Great quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20\'s who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts', 'They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men', 'A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected', 'Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year', 'He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID', 'She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response', 'Then testimony against the bill was heard', 'Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts', 'Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony', 'Other pro-gunners got up to testify', 'One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law', 'One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected', 'Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\'t know his citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver\'s license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms', 'A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings', 'Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings', 'The speaker then responded, ""I\'ll make you a deal', 'You get me the rope, and I\'ll tie the noose.""  Next came public testimony on the Simon\'s Rock bill', 'A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he wouldn\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside"" without his evil gun', 'She said that the ""loophole"" should be closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again""', 'Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators', 'One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there', 'Many of them had T shirts on, saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID', '""Only residents can get FID\'s,"" he said', '(How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters', 'Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens', 'Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record', 'One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist""', 'Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\'s home state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, ""Everyone\'s out of step but Johnny!""  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration', ""The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them"", 'Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked', 'Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it', 'Again, he brought up the state\'s archaic records capability and said, ""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?
