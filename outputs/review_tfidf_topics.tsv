Then the M sizes I received the second time were ALL different. Some larger some smaller. For example, the heather green one is as large as an L size compared to the others. The charcoal heather is much shorter than the heather blue. The best fit is the blue one, which matches an S size of other brand shirts I have, such as Nike or similar.

Consistency would save you a lot of re-shipments.', 'The shirt was too small. The medium fit like a small. The color on the website appeared to be mustard yellow.

I assume it has something to do with the graphic that is printed onto them, but also think a simple wash would take care of the smell. I had to wash them before wearing because the smell was almost unbearable. The other issue I had was that I ordered one tank top in ""light Heather"" color and when it came it was way lighter than pictured on the website. I got it with a Lord of the Rings graphic and a famous quote from the movie, written in gold. The quote is almost illegible with an almost white background, so it doesn\'t look right. I tried to go online for an exchange for a different color, but apparently you can only start a return or exchange if the size is wrong. Disappointing! I would have most likely gotten distracted by their many other designs and ended up buying at least one more shirt during the process of my return, but I guess I\'ll just keep the faulty tank and my money.

TeePublic's policies and practices severely limit the opportunities for new designers to showcase their work on the marketplace. To make matters worse, TeePublic banned me as soon as I started to gain some traction and earn a decent income. It seems that they view success as a threat rather than a reward. I was astounded by their lack of support and the absence of any explanation or warning for the ban. The abrupt termination of my account left me feeling betrayed and frustrated.TeePublic is an absolute nightmare for aspiring designers. They restrict the entry of new artists into their marketplace, ban successful designers without warning, and show little regard for the concerns and issues faced by their creative community.

I learned this for a fact.For context, I had put up almost ten designs on the site and hadn't been making a lot of sales over the course of almost two months. This part is understandable. I'm not blaming Teepublic for my lack of popularity. What I AM blaming them for is choosing to authorize and facilitate sales that DRAMATICALLY cut into my profits, to the point that I could sell two items and make a measly %25 of my potential profits. Where do they get off putting discounts on goods with MY designs on them without telling me WELL after they've been sold? They don't and shouldn't.

Everything you represented was right, I should have looked a little further to find the heavy cotton T. Along with the design, being much larger on the new shirt than the old. Again, I should have looked a little further into it before I ordered, but I am definitely pleased with the service, the price and the T-shirt.', 'Great customer service with prompt replies.', 'Really well made, really happy with my order!', 'High quality shirts! Just as pictured my husband wears a 4x and it was pretty true to size slightly short I would say size up if you want it a little longer.

Someone suggested getting one size up and I did and its perfect! thanks', ""So this is my second time ordering from this website. And my first order three shirts all defective gave up on the 3rd. Now. If a fourth one magically came up and it was done properly I'd be totally okay with it. But for this order I ordered two t-shirts not in red but one was in green and one was in purple. I had to get them redone because they were damaged upon. Just looking at them. The second time they look fantastic. I just hope they make it through the wash when people do receive them as their gifts and you know wash them as you would. But they look absolutely fantastic. No flaws, no nothing and I went through with a fine tooth comb. Now if I can see more of that in the future. I can't wait to buy more things for gifts for my friends and family. I should say it's the print, not the shirts that I've ever had problems with. Shirts are always really really good. It's the print on the shirt that has always been defective and horrible. So I guess we learned that I don't do two massive sales back to back and you have better quality control. And that you should have slightly less sales to give the print team time to actually do a good job. So I'm really proud of the print team. I just want to say thank you and that I hope to see more improvements and better everything so I can do more bragging about my independent artist and most importantly my independent artist. And well you guys too because you have been really good of customer support and everything else. Your patient your understanding and I know I'm I'm kind of being a little roast tastic. But anyone would be at this point just a little bit. But I honestly just want to say thank you for all the hard work and dedication and I can't wait to see people smile. And that is the best reason why I give gifts to people is just to see smiles in the world. Thank you for giving me the experience to review."", 'Creative designs, prices are great when on sale.', 'Great graphics, colors pop! Shirt fits nice!', 'I enjoy looking at the new designs.

Shipping was reasonable but the bag did have a slash on one side when it arrived. (Not entirely in TeePublic's control) We know how busy postal services have gotten and package are prone to more nicks and scrapes however it might be worth it then to double bag. Thankfully none of the shirts were damaged. The overall sizing was good however the smaller sizes we ordered weren't much smaller than the next size up. Of course there is always a 2cm variable (as explained on their sizing chart) but on at least one of the the shirts, the L was the same width as the XL. Still that's no big deal we expected some variation, the length however, of the L shirts was slightly longer than the XL. We dont expect TeePublic to cater to every shape, as is, they do have a great size range but If you have a shorter torso keep that in mind. The print quality varies per design. The smaller designs have been blown up to suit the larger shirts and has the slightest pixilation in some areas. I found any distortion to be minor and tolerable. But might be worth consideration if you intend to buy XL or larger. The type of print adhesion used is soft and doesn't feel rigid or plastic like some prints can be.

Considering how snug the fit was on the XL, I ordered a 3XL while I was at it rather just bumping up one size. I was only charged the additional $3 for choosing heavyweight fabric and a new shirt was ordered.

But these people sent me an email again restating that they wanted to be sure I was happy with my purchase. And this shirt was destined for a specific person, for whom it was too small, as well as having the thinner fabric. So I told them this time.I was treated so kindly by the people at this business regarding doing this return.

It also means that shirt quality and sizing is off. My 8yr old son wanted looser shirts so I ordered a menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s small rather than youth xxl. The shirts were longer but actually fit smaller.My older son who normally wears a menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s small looked like Winnie the Pooh in it. They were also a thinner, clingier material. Third, they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t stock plus sizes. If I want to order three different shirts in a 2x curvy v neck theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll all be black because thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s the only color they ever have available. Fourth, when they cak for them to refund the additional shipping costs, they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t automatically. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re great if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re looking for hard to find tees but I wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t count on them for gifts since you donï¿', 'Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a beagle person, as is my neighbor.

I messaged customer service and they were amazing and sent me new shirts at no extra cost and very quickly, received within a week. I switched to menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s XL, going a little big in case the sizing was off on the menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s too and they are a little bigger than I would like but not a deal breaker.
